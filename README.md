# Online Banking System
A basic online banking system is implemented with features like signing up, transferring and requesting money, mini-statement of transactions, notifications, etc. </br>
Used HTML and CSS as frontend and PHP and MYSQL as backend. Server - Apache</br>
Project done in 2017. (Lucky me, found the files burried in old hard drive)</br>
peace✌️
